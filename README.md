Workflow_finding_Onsen_neoinsertions

# This was the workflow to find ONSEN new insertions in re-sequenced transpositionally-competent nrpd1-3 lines.
# It uses standart open-source softwares in linux command-line and custome-made phyton scripts.
# It also involved some manual organization of files and manual assesment of results.
# Although it solved the problems faced at the time, note that this is a begginner's code, as I'm not a professional bioinformatician.
# As such, it is probably overly complicated; and other more advanced solutions are likely simpler or more effective.
# The workflow also display some historical contingencies, as I was learning while doing.
